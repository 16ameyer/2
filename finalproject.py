Description:
This program aims to educate individuals on information relating to volcanoes.
Users can choose to look at historical data of volcanic eruptions, or they can choose to analyze the difference in mean elevations for different volcanic regions.
The most interesting feature of Volcano 101 is the customized map that will focus on the specific volcanoes in a chosen country.
